# CRL Guide



Purpose: 
* to share knowledge 
* to ensure continuity 
* to set standards 


Every day place. 
You found a link on web - share it as a wiki if you want people to keep accessing it (and then send an email with that link). 

Reproducibility and Visibility - github and docker. 

Education - 
to share resources of links that others may be inspired by. 

How many useful things were lost in an email? 


----------

Welcome!

This wiki is aimed to be your one-stop shop for information to thrive at CRL. To navigate this wiki - use links below, use the sidebar or use the searchbox at the top left corner (see [this](https://blog.github.com/2016-08-08-search-wiki-pages/)).

This wiki is under **active development**. Please help us by contributing what you feel is missing. It is only by joint effort that we could make this work. Editing this wiki is _super easy_ and should take 10mins max to learn. We made a special guide for you here. 

Moreover, you will learn how to contribute to Wiki and use advanced Github features - which is really cool! 

Most of all - do *not* be afraid of breaking something! Github allows us to roll back any changes by looking at commit history! And we will always help!

## Sys Admin

Hello Sean, Clemente, Simon - we have migrated the old confluence sysadmin [here](). It's stored in a separate private github repository for security reasons. 

## Confluence

We moved the [old Confluence pages](http://leko.tch.harvard.edu:8090/display) to this github. Unfortunately the conversion script wasn't perfect, so this is very much still a Work-In-Progress. Please help us to edit these confluence pages if you are a seasoned CRL member. Many pages need removing altogether.
