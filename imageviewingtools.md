### Image viewers- ITKsnap and misterI 

These are two different software tools for viewing files. 

I do not use misterI very much but it is very useful for DCE stuff. 

This tool was developed by Benoit in our lab. 

It is heavily used by Jaume, Clemente. 

The path to misterI is in my bash. 

I prefer to use ITKsnap myself. This is a public tool that you can download online. 

It loads .nii.gz, .nrrd, .vtk images. 

You can also view 4D files in it. 

I can show you tips and tricks how this works. 

I think Sila uses this also heavily, like myself. 

Finally, there is also a tool called crlViz. I haven't used it much. 

Ask Onur for more info on this.
