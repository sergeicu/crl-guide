### Suggestions from Simon on linux crash course: 

You might find some resources to teach the truly new e.g.

[https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.vikingcodeschool.com_web-2Ddevelopment-2Dbasics_a-2Dcommand-2Dline-2Dcrash-2Dcourse&d=DwMDaQ&c=qS4goWBT7poplM69zy_3xhKwEW14JZMSdioCoppxeFU&r=b4Nb-lF5XBCiHWj64StekdJQgylGzYqrVQ9qwCO9n5Om_qHh04diXz6BW5PQjq3i&m=NGbZh8kPEQ97Y4he2ABoq02lgiLg4k5TLVs6hLN-vMQ&s=GfDU9g1nn8qxry77FZWcHnHdTMEOVshZvlx36xfAn4c&e=)

### Suggestions from Serge on unix shell scripting crash course 

I absolutely love this guide 

[http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/lectures/scripting/all.htm](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/lectures/scripting/all.htm)


### Crash course on MR physics, Neuroanatomy, MRI Artifacts, Git, Grant Writing, Python, Diffusion MRI

I found these guide from Martinos to be invaluable and very relevant - 

[https://gate.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/wiki/whynhow/index.php/Main_Page](https://gate.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/wiki/whynhow/index.php/Main_Page)

I will add more links over time (IF YOU HAVE ANY NICE LINKS FOR ANY TOPICS THAT MAY BE USEFUL TO OTHERS AT CRL  - please add them here with your name!)

### [info] Suggestions for improvements to CRL guide 


##### Suggestions from Simon 

I would put these in the categories of:

1. UNIX

2. programming

3. anatomy

4. imaging

I have saved this lab template as a good starting point:

[https://osf.io/4vfg7/](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__osf.io_4vfg7_&d=DwMDaQ&c=qS4goWBT7poplM69zy_3xhKwEW14JZMSdioCoppxeFU&r=b4Nb-lF5XBCiHWj64StekdJQgylGzYqrVQ9qwCO9n5Om_qHh04diXz6BW5PQjq3i&m=NGbZh8kPEQ97Y4he2ABoq02lgiLg4k5TLVs6hLN-vMQ&s=c-u2SoB9KzHYzwSvJ2gswvZZ0bhJrLEdHh-vSWTYq6g&e=)

I also like the overall thrust of this information:

[https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_HBClab_LabManual&d=DwMDaQ&c=qS4goWBT7poplM69zy_3xhKwEW14JZMSdioCoppxeFU&r=b4Nb-lF5XBCiHWj64StekdJQgylGzYqrVQ9qwCO9n5Om_qHh04diXz6BW5PQjq3i&m=NGbZh8kPEQ97Y4he2ABoq02lgiLg4k5TLVs6hLN-vMQ&s=7K7OzOqyK1kxjB98I1xvF6FoOzbbYSznmSyx8iwlh_0&e=)

Besides explaining to people how to find what they need, I think it is helpful to articulate the skills they need.

### [TODO] Reproducibility Series

_I am preparing a ‘Research Reproducibility Series’ for CRL in the coming weeks. _

_This will consist of collaborative workshops to learn the following tools (see below). _



*   _Tools _
    *   _Git _
        *   _Inc: Git 101, Github, Github pages, Videos _
    *   _Docker _
    *   _Conda _
    *   _Jupyter Lab _
    *   _Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE _
    *   _Research Computing _
        *   _Using BCH Google Drive _
        *   _Using CPUs and GPUs _
    *   _Deep Learning _
        *   _Tricks and Tips (advanced) _
    *   _Overleaf _
*   _Research profile _
    *   _Google scholar, Harvard ID thing, Research Gate _
*   _Grant writing @ CRL _
    *   _Need to ask Simon to lead this _

_The series would be structured like this: _



*   _The group will meet each week to pick a particular topic for the next week, e.g. Github _
*   _A group lead will share some resources (suggested articles and videos) for the group to read _
*   _The participants will go away and learn on their own by reading / watching the suggested resources (and maybe finding more interesting stuff) _
*   _Each participant will also have their own individual mini project assigned for the week, so that they can learn on the topic._
*   _E.g. take your most recent paper and turn it into a github repository, make small modifications and push the changes, create a new branch, create TODO list _
*   _On the next week the group will meet to review progress, discuss, and pick a new topic with new mini project _

_The series would <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not </span>be structured as lectures. There is plenty of material online to learn from. Instead the series would be a collaborative effort to work together and support and discuss together. _

_After the series finishes the shared resources will be published on CRL github pages. _


### Misc
