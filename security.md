#### A note on secure work 

Once you are logged into BCH VPN with your PulseSecure app on your laptop, your ipaddress is technically that of BCH. 

BCH recommends to be connected onPulseSecure <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only </span>when you really need to access BCH resources. So don't forget to disconnect PulseSecure after you finished for the day, or if you do not need to use servers/data from BCH (e.g. when reading papers etc).
