First port of admin related or technical related help is Sean :) 

If you have general technical IT issues - email <span style="text-decoration:underline;">IThelpdesk@childrens.harvard.edu</span>

If you have general non IT issues - email <span style="text-decoration:underline;">help.desk@childrens.harvard.edu</span>

However, help desk is rather slow. Sometimes it takes days to get a response. If you need help right away it is best to just call them. 

Go to [web2] > eHelp to find phone contact details for IT or HR services.
