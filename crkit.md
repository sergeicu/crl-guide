### Image processing tools - CRKIT 

This is a collection of tools developed internally at CRL for all sorts of imaging tasks. 

Most of these are C++ binaries. 

Many of these are already incorporated into CRL libraries, e.g. in DCE reconstruction. 

There are also many other useful commands like: 

- crlConvertBetweenFileFormats

- crlDcmConvert

- dcmdump 

etc 

There are more than 300 different functions here. 

One big problem is that there isn't really any easy documentation or tutorial to follow (that I know of!) 

I will ask someone at CRL later to give us all a tutorial on this via Zoom. 

I myself wanted to learn about it for a long time.
