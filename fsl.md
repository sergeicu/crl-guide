#### Inside terminal 

I found FSL library to be extremely useful when working with nifti images for various kinds of image processing operations. 

All commands are invoked inside the linux terminal. 

Especially useful is the `fslmaths` function. 

You can find path to it in my bashrc. 

I assume that CRKIT also has similar functions (but someone has to guide us on these in a tutorial).
