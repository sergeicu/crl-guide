### New Lab Members 

_[the following was suggested by Simon after he had read this guide]_

- new lab members should write a brief bio about themselves and send me the bio and a picture/headshot to put on the web site.

- each time someone has a paper accepted, they should write a brief blurb about it and provide the manuscript to be added to the web site.








## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">GETTING STARTED</span>


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">BCH IT account</span>

With the BCH IT account you can 

1. access BCH email

2. login to your BCH CRL machine 

3. access CRL storage devices and machines

4. access relevant BCH services like insurance, pay, zoom, research computing, etc 

In the above section I already told you about 3. 

Next I will tell you about 4. 


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">BCH IT onboarding </span>

(for Aziz only)

Aziz - to get the account you will receive instructions from BCH IT. 

Just a note - BCH has recently heavily upgraded security for remote work. 

So you will need to complete a seemingly infinite list of admin tasks.

e.g.  

- provide BCH IT people with your personal phone number

- hold a special call with them verify your identity

- download Duo Mobile app on your phone

- download Pulse Secure app on your laptop

- encrypt your own laptop and phone. 

Once again - don't worry about these - you will get instructions how to do it. If any questions - ask us. 


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">BCH research safety and security </span>

You will be required to pass various research safety and security related courses via a system called NetLearning. 

This would take at least some hours also, so plan ahead. 

There may be additional administrative to do in regards to Sila/Onurs IRBs, which are project dependent. They will tell you more about it. 


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">CITI TRAINING</span>

In addition to NetLearning, you will also need to pass CITI courses. 

The link to the internal CITI instructions is here: [http://web2.tch.harvard.edu/biobank/mainpageS3005P46.html.](http://web2.tch.harvard.edu/biobank/mainpageS3005P46.html)

You will need to create a CITI account and list Boston Children's Hospital as your institution, and then complete the appropriate training/s. In your case, I recommend completing the CITI Biomedical course and the Conflict of Interest Training. 

Once you've completed your courses, send your CITI transcript to Sean, and he will arrange to have you added to CHERP and the appropriate IRB/s. 


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Web2 intranet</span>

There is a large amount of admin related things that you can do here - 

[http://web2.tch.harvard.edu/index.html](http://web2.tch.harvard.edu/index.html) [web2]

in order to access this intranet site you need to be logged in to BCH VPN. 

Most useful things are: 

1. elect your benefits (like health insurance stuff)

2. manage your pay 

3. pass NetLearning courses

4. change your BCH password remotely 

5. find tools to encrypt your phone and laptop 

7. schedule your own Zoom invites (with no time limit)

How to get to these things: 

for 1 or 2. - [web2] (see link above) > Human Resources (top tab) > People Soft (side tab)

for 3. - [web2] (see link above) > Human Resources (top tab) > Net Learning (side tab)

for 4. - [web2] > eHelp (side tab) > accounts and password (side tab) 

for 5. - [web2] > eHelp (side tab) > BYOD (side tab) 

for 6. - [web2] > Zoom (side tab)
