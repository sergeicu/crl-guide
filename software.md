# Software

Most of the CRL's shared software tools live here 
`/opt/el7/pkgs/`. 

Below you will find a more-or-less comprehensive list of these tools. 

For some tools we had written dedicated sub pages with instructions. 

Tools that are written internally are marked with \*. We hope to make most of these tools available via Github asap (also as Docker containers).
